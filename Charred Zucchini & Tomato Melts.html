If not, pull up the camera on your phone... This magical melt has two kinds of the good stuff: fresh mozzarella and Monterey Jack. Together, they create a gooey, stretchy, cheese-tastic situation that\u2019s totally \u2019gram-worthy. Oh, and did we mention there\u2019s veggies in there, too? Tender pieces of zucchini and tomato are nestled inside the garlic-butter-slathered slices of sourdough.
