Once hot, crack two eggs (four eggs for 4) into pan and cover. (For 4, you may want to cook eggs in batches.) Fry eggs to preference. Season with salt and pepper. Top flatbreads with fried eggs. Quarter flatbreads and divide between plates. If you\u2019ve got some on hand, sprinkle with chili flakes from your pantry if desired. Bacon is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145\u00b0. Wash hands and surfaces after handling raw eggs. Consuming raw or undercooked eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness."}]}</script></div></body></html>
