Before you answer \u201cno,\u201d please allow us to introduce you to hotel butter. It\u2019s a compound butter, a.k.a. butter mixed with other delicious stuff, and this version has finely chopped parsley and garlic. Once you place a dollop onto your seared steak, it\u2019ll melt and make you feel all swoony (like when you see your favorite celebrity). Side effects of hotel butter: wanting to add it to just about everything. We highly recommend melting any extra to drizzle over popcorn the next time you\u2019re watching a movie (you know, that one starring your above-mentioned crush).", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.everyplate.com/c_fill,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_800,q_auto,w_1600/everyplate_s3/image/63bc4724b8c0d1212f0a6798-ffd126c1.jpg"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounce Potatoes", "1 clove Garlic", "1 unit Parsley", "10 ounce Ranch Steak", "1 unit Sliced Almonds", "1 unit Green Beans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
