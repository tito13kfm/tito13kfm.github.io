This week, we\u2019re serving up donburi, the Japanese version of the dish. We\u2019ve customized it with roasted broccoli, spiced sweet potato, fried eggs, and pickled cucumber, plus a creamy, spicy, tangy Sriracha mayo for drizzling. You\u2019re gonna be totally bowled over.", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.everyplate.com/c_fill,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_800,q_auto,w_1600/everyplate_s3/image/63a1c6b52d7b1b75b200542f-20c37717.jpg"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 unit White Rice", "1 unit Broccoli", "1 unit Sriracha", "1 unit Fry Seasoning", "2 unit Sweet Potato", "1 unit Mini Cucumber", "1 unit Lime", "1 unit Scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and dice sweet potatoes into \u00bd-inch pieces (for speedier spud prep, skip the peeling!). Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites; cook until softened, 1 minute. Stir in rice, 1\u00bd cups water (3 cups for 4), and 1 tsp salt (2 tsp for 4). Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 16-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While rice cooks, toss sweet potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the Fry Seasoning (all for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. Roast for 12 minutes, then remove sheet from oven. Carefully toss broccoli on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Return to oven until veggies are browned and tender, 12-15 minutes more."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, trim and dice cucumber. Zest and quarter lime. In a small bowl, combine cucumber, juice from half the lime, \u00bc tsp sugar (\u00bd tsp for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a second small bowl, combine 4 TBSP mayonnaise (8 TBSP for 4 servings), Sriracha, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Season with salt. When veggies have about 5 minutes left, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, crack two eggs (four eggs for 4) into pan and cover. (For 4, you may want to cook eggs in batches.) Fry eggs to preference. Season with salt and pepper."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and a pinch of salt. Divide rice between bowls and top with roasted veggies, pickled cucumber (draining first), and a fried egg. Drizzle with Sriracha mayo and sprinkle with scallion greens. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side. Wash hands and surfaces after handling raw eggs. Consuming raw or undercooked eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness."}]}</script></div></body></html>
