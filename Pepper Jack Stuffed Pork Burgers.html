And if that cheese happens to be flecked with bits of jalape\u00f1o? Even better. A Southwest-spiced pork patty is the perfect vehicle for pickled jalape\u00f1o, juicy tomato slices, and cooling crema. To bring it all home, this molten masterpiece is served alongside crispy oven fries. (Would it really be a burger without \u2018em??)", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.everyplate.com/c_fill,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_800,q_auto,w_1600/everyplate_s3/image/pepper-jack-stuffed-pork-burgers-77cd871d.jpg"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounce Ground Pork", "1 unit Shredded Pepper Jack", "1 unit Southwest Spice", "5 unit Potatoes", "1 unit Potato Buns", "1 unit Tomato", "1 unit Jalape\u00f1o", "1 unit Sour Cream", "1 unit White Wine Vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Cut potatoes into \u00bd-inch-thick wedges. Thinly slice jalape\u00f1o into rounds, removing ribs and seeds for less heat. Thinly slice tomato into rounds. Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the Southwest Spice Blend (you\u2019ll use the rest in the next step), salt, and pepper. Roast until golden brown and crispy, 20-25 minutes."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine jalape\u00f1o and vinegar. Season with salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, gently combine pork, remaining Southwest Spice Blend, salt (we used \u00be tsp; 1\u00bd tsp for 4 servings), and pepper."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Form pork mixture into two very thin rounds (four rounds for 4 servings). Divide cheese between the centers of each round. Fold edges of meat around cheese, shaping and sealing to create cheese-stuffed patties, each a bit wider than a burger bun. Season all over with salt and pepper."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add cheese-stuffed patties and cook until browned on first side, 4-7 minutes. Flip and reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned and cooked through, 4-7 minutes more. (No worries if some of the cheese oozes out! The end result will still be delicious\u2014can you say crispy cheese?)"}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While patties cook, halve buns; place cut sides up on a baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden, 3-5 minutes. In a second small bowl, combine sour cream and 1 tsp water (2 tsp for 4 servings). Season with salt and pepper."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spread cut sides of top buns with crema. Fill buns with patties, sliced tomato, and as much pickled jalape\u00f1o (draining first) as you\u2019d like. Divide between plates; serve with potato wedges and, if you\u2019ve got some on hand, ketchup on the side for dipping. (If you want to see some melty cheese action, cut the burgers in half!) Ground Pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160\u00b0."}]}</script></div></body></html>
