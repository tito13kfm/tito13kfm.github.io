(Hello, Chicago-style popcorn & peanut butter-pickle sandwiches! ...please tell us we\u2019re not the only ones.) This ode to the dynamic flavor duo takes the form of a delicious, layered rice bowl. You\u2019ve got your fluffy, lime-zest-flecked rice, your ground turkey in a tangy-sweet ponzu and ginger glaze, your perfectly fried eggs, your tender saut\u00e9ed zucchini and carrot\u2014pauses to take a huge breath in\u2014AND your sweet and spicy soy-sriracha drizzle. WHEW. Now, if we could just get our chefs to buy into our idea for a BBQ ice cream sundae..", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.everyplate.com/c_fill,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_800,q_auto,w_1600/everyplate_s3/image/ginger-ponzu-turkey-bowls-4b5494b2.jpg"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 unit Ground Turkey", "1 unit White Rice", "1 unit Sweet Soy Glaze", "3 unit Ponzu Sauce", "3 ounce Carrot", "1 unit Zucchini", "1 unit Sriracha", "1 unit Ginger", "2 clove Garlic", "1 unit Lime"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash and dry all produce. Place rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse until water runs clear. Add to a small pot along with 1 cup water (2 cups for 4 servings) and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15 minutes. Keep covered off heat for at least 10 minutes or until ready to serve."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, zest and quarter lime. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; slice crosswise into \u00bd-inch-thick half-moons. Trim and peel carrot. Using a peeler, shave carrot lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go, until you get to the core; discard core. Peel and finely chop ginger and garlic. In a small bowl, combine half the sweet soy glaze (you\u2019ll use the rest later) with as much sriracha and lime juice as you\u2019d like."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add carrot ribbons and toss to combine. Cook, stirring, until carrot is slightly softened and zucchini is tender, 3-4 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer veggies to a plate; set aside."}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add ginger and garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add turkey; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.
